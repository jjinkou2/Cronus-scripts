hi, 

my message is for cronus programmers. 

i would like to share a brand new algorithm to people who would like to program more efficiently this tiny beast cronus max. 
This algorithm is really less greedy in memory than the 2 existing here. 
Caution though: this script is not heavily tested so if you want something reliable, stick to TC 's script or KW4S's one. 

The whole holidays_loop stays in only ONE slot and takes only 40% of memory.
It only lacks the swimsuit buying, but hey, there is still left 60% of free memory and 8 empty slots! 
I may add the swimsuit in future release.    

I thank people here to make me discover this amazing device, TC and KW4S scripts, 
and Cronus forum programmers that excel in development. I read a lot of scripts 
before sharing this code. 

------
Ok lets see how it 's done: 

The cronus max is a microcontroller, that translates into power but fewer memory than PC or smartphone. It has also 
a peculiar language script that will bang your head into walls sometimes. But i took that more of a challenge 
than a burden. This device will oblige you to think out of the box. 

So instead of whinning on memory lack, just leverage on its assets : power and script features
To reach to goal of less memory, this scripts uses 3 points: 

- The 1rst one is the most important : DATASET, use and abuse it. that's how you keep microcontroller not a jabba hutt memory cruncher.
- 2nd: RTFM !  you can read n the manual:"main is a loop". I repeat "MAIN IS A LOOP"! i'll come back on this point. 
- 3rd: State automata machine is the key to this peculiar language. 

Ok lets go back to the 1rst point. DATASET. It's a bunch of bytes not organised. So it's up to you to 
organise it. Forget your python list / ruby object /C structures. You 'll have to structure it yourself. 
For this algorithm i just needed 
  - a entry point (cb_intro), 
  - a set of combo 
  - and a Id for the end of combo (EOC).

//  Idx, Button,       Wait(x50ms),     Event
//---------------------------------------------------------------
//      Introduction
data(
    cb_intro,
        PS4_CIRCLE,      80,         //  Travel to zack island
        PS4_CIRCLE,      100,        //
        PS4_OPTIONS,     10,         //  skip intro video
        PS4_OPTIONS,     100,         //
    EOC,
...

then it needs a function that read that kind of structure : "function get_combo_index(combo_id)" 
I copied it from a Mortal Kombat script found at cronus forum. I then wrote the State "Play_combo"
to read the combo till EOC. 

this dataset efficiently replaces the repetitive and memory greeding: 
	combo_run(PS4_XX,100);wait...

2/ Main Loop
lets move on the 2nd point: MAIN IS A LOOP. You don't need While/ForLoop. That's pretty challenging
at first: how can i loop / branch to somewhere in my code ? I don't know you, but for me that's
really interessing when you have to give away your habits and explore new paths. 
Ok if main is a loop, so there's a way to loop my combo/function/code in some sort of way. 
Have you read the manual ? no ?so i'll let you re-read the chapter Combo. yes it is clearly written how too loop. 
 
so instead of repeating : call (rapid_square) x 10, just use the power of the microcontroller that 
loop every 10ms the main. 

3/ State machine
Now the Last point : State automata machine. Franckly, without state automata, Cronus scripts look like 
a raging bull. Now with this tool, i take it by the horns. Look at the code after the if (play). 
with State programming, you develop small modules that you will plug each one.

----------------------

Ok Long story short, if you wanna try this script here is a little quick start. 

Getting the script: http://cronusmax.com/gpclib/?s=3119 


  /*-------------------------*/
 /*  Quick start            */
/*--------------------------/----------------------------------------------

    1) Before starting the script, just change the character
       in the config paragraph below (§CAR_Config)

    2) Important : Make sure the inventory of your selected character is empty.

    3) Start the script :
        a) with Triangle if you are at the beginning of the game. (travel to zack island)
        You can Pause/Play the script too with triangle.

        b) with R2 if you are at the beginning of the day.

    4) Stop the script with R1.
       If the script broke, manually move the game to the beginning of the next day
       and press R2 to restart it.

       Note: You may have to resynchronise the day number by pressing several L1
       (look at TRACE_4 which displays the day number)

    Color Led:
    ----------
        - BLUE              : Script is Stopped
        - RED               : Script is Paused
        - GREEN             : Script is Playing

    Troubleshooting:
    ---------
    - TRACE_3 displays the state where the script is.
      Look at §State_Definition for the matching state

    - TRACE_4 displays the day number. If the script is stuck or if something
      goes wrong, stop the script, manually move the game to the next day
      then adjust the day number inside TRACE_4 by pressing L1.

    - If you want to test a specific set of Data, use the function DebugCombo
      and press L2.
